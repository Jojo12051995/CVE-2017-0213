### CVE-2017-0213
I used the code provided by the Google Project Zero Team here:  https://github.com/WindowsExploits/Exploits/tree/master/CVE-2017-0213 
The changes I made allow the program to call a powershell oneliner that will give me an Empire agent on the target.
I will use this for privilege escalation through Empire.
I know it is not a powershell/python script so it kind of ruins the spirit of Empire... but oh well; it gets me a system shell which I like :)
